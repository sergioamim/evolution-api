# 2.4.0-rc2 (2026-05-17)

Estabilização sobre `2.4.0-rc1`. Sem mudanças de banco nem de contrato HTTP — apenas fixes em fluxos do Baileys/WhatsApp e Evolution Channel, suporte nativo a GIF e um caminho opcional de auto-ativação headless da licença.

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp — bypass de validação `onWhatsApp` para contatos `@lid`** ([#2544](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/pull/2544)). Após a migração para LID (Linked Identity) do WhatsApp, contatos cujo JID termina em `@lid` retornavam `exists: false` no `onWhatsApp` da Baileys, fazendo `sendMessageWithTyping` e `sendPresence` lançarem `BadRequestException`. O bypass que já existia para `@broadcast` foi estendido para incluir `@lid`.

- **WhatsApp — `quoted` agora é propagado em `sendWhatsAppAudio`** ([#2516](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/pull/2516), corrige [#2485](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/issues/2485)). Envios de áudio com payload `quoted` deixavam de chegar como resposta encadeada — o áudio caía como mensagem solta. Corrigido nos dois caminhos do `audioWhatsapp` (encoded e direct).

- **Instance API — `instanceName` agora é trimado na criação** ([#2546](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/pull/2546), corrige [#2543](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/issues/2543)). Nomes com espaços inicial/final eram persistidos no banco mas, ao serem chamados via URL (`DELETE /instance/delete/:name`), os espaços eram normalizados, gerando `404` por mismatch. Aplicado `.trim()` no início de `createInstance`.

- **Evolution Channel — instâncias deixam de ficar travadas em `close`** ([#2420](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/pull/2420), corrige [#2419](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/issues/2419)). Como o Evolution Channel é webhook-only (passivo), a instância deveria estar sempre `open`. Agora, no boot do monitor e na criação da instância, `connectToWhatsapp()` é chamado para instâncias `EVOLUTION` e o `connectionStatus` é persistido como `open` no banco.

### Added

- **WhatsApp — suporte nativo a GIF sem conversão para vídeo** ([#2540](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evolution-api/pull/2540)). DTO e schema de envio de mídia agora aceitam `gifPlayback` (boolean) e `gifAttribution` (0/1/2), propagados para a Baileys. Backward-compat preservado: default segue `gifPlayback: false` quando o cliente não envia o campo.

- **Licensing — auto-ativação headless via `EVOLUTION_OPERATOR_EMAIL`**. Quando a env `EVOLUTION_OPERATOR_EMAIL` está configurada, o `initializeRuntime` chama silenciosamente o endpoint `/v1/register/auto` do licensing server no boot, persiste a `api_key` retornada e ativa a instância — pulando o fluxo de registro pelo browser. **Pré-requisito**: o e-mail precisa ter sido registrado uma vez previamente no licensing server. Em qualquer falha (e-mail desconhecido, servidor inacessível, key suspensa) o sistema **faz fallback não-fatal** para o fluxo de registro manual no `/manager`.

### Notas para upgrade a partir de `2.4.0-rc1`

- Não há mudança de banco nem de contrato HTTP — basta atualizar a imagem.
- Quem usa `sendWhatsAppAudio` com `quoted` passa a ver o áudio como resposta encadeada (comportamento agora alinhado aos demais métodos de envio).
- Instâncias do Evolution Channel que estavam em `close` no banco serão promovidas a `open` no próximo boot. Se você dependia desse estado para pausar instâncias manualmente, considere usar outro mecanismo de gate, pois esse fluxo passa a ser sobrescrito.

# 2.4.0 (2026-05-06)

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE — License activation is now required

Starting with v2.4.0, every Evolution API instance must be activated against the
Evolution Foundation licensing server before serving API traffic. Until activation,
all business endpoints return:

```
HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
{
  "error": "service not activated",
  "code": "LICENSE_REQUIRED",
  "register_url": "https://<your-host>/manager/login",
  "instance_id": "<uuid>",
  "docs_url": "https://docs.evolutionfoundation.com.br/licensing",
  "message": "..."
}
```

The following routes always remain public so the operator can recover:
`/license/status`, `/license/register`, `/license/activate`, `/manager/**`,
`/health`, `/server/ok`, `/ws`, static assets.

### Migration guide

1. Pull the new version and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git pull
   npm install
   ```

2. Apply the new migration (creates the `RuntimeConfig` table). Required:
   ```bash
   npm run db:deploy
   ```
   If you skip this step, the server now fails fast with a clear error
   asking you to run `db:deploy`.

3. Start the service. There are three activation paths:

   - **Already have a valid licensing key?** Set it as `AUTHENTICATION_API_KEY`
     in your `.env` and restart. The bootstrap step will validate the key with
     the licensing server, persist it, and activate the instance automatically.

   - **First-time activation via the manager UI?** Open
     `https://<your-host>/manager/login`. The manager detects that the
     instance is unlicensed and redirects you to the registration page on
     the licensing server. After you complete the form, you are sent back
     to `/manager/license/callback?code=...`, the manager exchanges the code,
     and the dashboard becomes accessible.

   - **Calling the API from code (n8n, Make, custom scripts) without a valid
     license?** Every request will receive `503 LICENSE_REQUIRED` with the
     `register_url` field pointing to the manager. Open it in a browser to
     activate.

### Added

#### Manager v2 — completely redesigned dashboard

The embedded manager (served at `/manager`) was rebuilt from the ground up
on **Tailwind v4** + the new **`@evoapi/design-system`**, using the same
visual language as the rest of the Evolution Foundation product line.
Every screen was refactored — no surface remains untouched.

Highlights:

- **Modern dashboard** with skeleton loading, illustrated empty state,
  and a typed-name confirmation modal for instance deletion (no more
  accidental clicks).
- **Dual-provider support**: the manager now talks to either
  `evolution-api` or `evolution-go` (selected at login, persisted in
  localStorage). When connected to a GO backend, the sidebar/router
  automatically hide the modules GO does not implement.
- **Sessions panels** for the seven chatbot integrations (OpenAI, Dify,
  N8N, EvoAI, EvolutionBot, Flowise, Typebot) gained advanced filters
  (name / number / status / time presets + custom),
  bulk-status-change actions, client-side pagination, and a real
  send-message modal calling `/message/sendText`.
- **License-aware login** — see the *Licensing* section below for the
  details.
- **🧪 Test Interactive** modal on each instance card — a 5-tab
  payload editor (Reply / CTA / PIX / List / Carousel) for
  smoke-testing the new interactive-message endpoints from the
  dashboard. Replaces the legacy stand-alone `test-interactive.js`
  vanilla script that used to be injected into `index.html`.
- **Full i18n coverage** in **pt-BR / en-US / es-ES / fr-FR** — every
  screen, every toast, every modal.
- **Branding refresh** — sidebar/footer/login point to
  `docs.evolutionfoundation.com.br`, GitHub links to
  `evolution-foundation/evolution-manager-v2`, contact to
  `suporte@evofoundation.com.br`.

The new bundle is shipped pre-built under `manager/dist/`. The manager
source repository moved to `evolution-foundation/evolution-manager-v2`
(private) — the previous in-repo submodule was dropped.

#### Licensing
- **Licensing module** under `src/licensing/` — RuntimeContext, gate middleware,
  signed/unsigned HTTP transport, hardware-based instance ID, fire-and-forget
  heartbeat (every 30 min), graceful shutdown deactivation. Mirrors the
  evolution-go `pkg/core/` reference implementation.
- **Public license endpoints**:
  - `GET /license/status` — current activation state and (masked) api_key
  - `GET /license/register?redirect_uri=` — initiates registration on the
    licensing server, returns `register_url`
  - `GET /license/activate?code=` — exchanges the authorization code received
    on the callback for a real api_key, persists it, marks the runtime active.
- **New Prisma model** `RuntimeConfig` (key/value rows in `RuntimeConfig` table)
  for both PostgreSQL and MySQL schemas.
- **Auto-detect missing migration**: if the `RuntimeConfig` table is absent,
  the server prints a clear banner explaining `npm run db:deploy` and exits 1
  instead of throwing a stack trace from the Prisma client.
- **Manager v2** ships with the new license-aware login flow that recognises
  HTTP 503 / `LICENSE_REQUIRED`, calls `/license/register`, and redirects to
  the registration server. After the callback, it lands on
  `/manager/license/callback?code=...` and finalises activation. The new
  manager bundle is included under `manager/dist/`.

#### Interactive Messages (Buttons / List / CTA / PIX / Carousel)
- **New endpoint `POST /message/sendCarousel/{instance}`** — multi-card
  product carousel built on top of `interactiveMessage` + `carouselMessage`.
  Single-card-without-image falls back to `nativeFlowMessage` for iOS
  compatibility. New DTO `SendCarouselDto`, schema `carouselMessageSchema`.
- **Button rendering fixed on WhatsApp Web/Desktop/iOS/Android** — removed the
  `viewOnceMessage` wrapper that prevented buttons from rendering and started
  injecting the required `<biz><interactive type=native_flow v=1>
  <native_flow v=9 name=mixed/></interactive></biz>` node into the
  `relayMessage` stanza via Baileys' official `additionalNodes` option.
- **List messages fixed on WhatsApp Web/Desktop** — switched to legacy
  `listMessage` with `SINGLE_SELECT` listType (the modern
  `interactiveMessage + single_select` format does not render on Web/Desktop)
  and added `<biz><list type=product_list v=2/></biz>`.
- **Interactive buttons via `deviceSentMessage`** + corrected CTA limits
  (max 2 CTA buttons, no mixing with reply or PIX), aligning with the
  WhatsApp Business message contract.
- **PIX support** for interactive button messages (`payment_info` button
  type — exactly 1 button, isolated).
- **Quoted product / Catalog `orderMessage`** support — handles
  `quotedMessage.productMessage` and the catalog `orderMessage` shape,
  including `getTypeMessage` enrichment, deduplication cache for
  processed order IDs, and propagation through Chatwoot integration.
- Manager UI: a `🧪 Test Interactive` button on each instance card opens
  a modal with five tabs (Reply / CTA / PIX / List / Carousel) and an
  editable JSON payload — useful for smoke-testing every kind of
  interactive message without leaving the dashboard.

#### History Sync
- **New event `messaging-history.set`** emitted on sync completion, with
  cumulative counts (chats, contacts, messages, isLatest, progress).
  Allows downstream consumers to know exactly when a history sync has
  finished and how much was imported.
- Cumulative counters reset on a new sync start to avoid carry-over
  between consecutive syncs.

#### Other
- **New endpoint `POST /chat/markMessageAsPlayed/{instance}`** — emits the
  audio "played" receipt (PTT/VOICE), completing the read/delivered/played
  triplet for voice messages.
- **SQS integration** now accepts a custom `base_url` (useful for
  LocalStack and corporate VPC endpoints).
- **LID → phone-number mapping and caching** — translates the new
  `@lid` identifiers WhatsApp uses for hidden-phone profiles into the
  real `@s.whatsapp.net` JID for downstream processing, with a cache
  to avoid redundant lookups.

#### Branding / Documentation
- README, LICENSE, NOTICE, TRADEMARKS standardised under the
  **Evolution Foundation 2026** identity.
- All GitHub URLs migrated from `EvolutionAPI` to `evolution-foundation`.
- New README section "License Activation" linking to
  <https://docs.evolutionfoundation.com.br/licensing>.

### Fixed

- **`mentionsEveryOne` honours `false`** — earlier the flag was always
  applied regardless of value (#2470).
- **`getLastMessage`**: corrected the Prisma JSON path filter so the
  query returns the actual last message (#2495 / #2515).
- **`markMessageAsRead`**: corrected JID filter to cover all user types
  (regular, business, broadcast, group).
- **List messages**: removed destructive JSON cloning that triggered
  `this.isZero` when the message contained `Long`-typed fields (#2461).
- **History sync race condition**: completion event is now emitted
  *before* the contact upsert, so consumers don't observe the sync as
  finished while contacts are still being written (#2510).
- **Business API (Cloud)**: race condition in sender identification
  resolved (#2493); execution order normalised; `chatwootIds`
  correctly propagated.
- **`/instance/logout/{instance}`** — idempotent: returns SUCCESS instead
  of 400 when the instance is already closed, so the manager UI delete
  flow (logout-then-delete) does not surface a misleading error.
- **`remove.instance` event** — emitted even when logout itself fails,
  preventing zombie instances after a partially failed delete (#2520).
- **Chatbot session**: a closed session no longer blocks bot
  re-activation.
- **Docker compose**: fresh-install startup failures resolved.
- **WhatsApp chats**: `accountLid` handling, `remoteJid` normalisation
  and `chatsRaw` mapping cleaned up to avoid mismatched contact data
  on first connection.
- **Facebook ads**: `externalAdReply` context readability and fallback
  path for missing fields.
- **Networking**: added the `--network-family-autoselection-attempt-timeout`
  flag in `start:prod` so IPv4/IPv6 races no longer hang the boot on
  hosts with broken IPv6.
- **Trailing slashes** on configuration URLs are now tolerated in all
  HTTP clients.
- Verbose-log fix: undefined `maxRetries` reference inside the
  `messages.update` handler.

### Notes

- `AUTHENTICATION_API_KEY` keeps its original meaning (global API key for
  business endpoints) **and** gains a second use as the bootstrap license
  key. If the value you have is a real licensing key, activation is silent.
  If it is not, the service starts unlicensed and waits for activation via
  the manager.
- Activation is a one-time operation. The `api_key` is stored in the database
  and reused across restarts. The licensing server is only consulted again
  for periodic heartbeats (telemetry — non-blocking) and on graceful shutdown
  (`/v1/deactivate`).
- If the licensing server is unreachable but the instance has been activated
  before, the service continues to serve traffic normally — local DB is the
  source of truth for activation state after the first successful call.
- Release builds bake the licensing endpoint into the bundle as an XOR-encoded
  string via tsup `define`, so the URL never appears as a plain literal in
  `dist/main.js`. Generate the pair with `node tools/encode-url.js <url>` and
  pass `LICENSE_ENDPOINT_ENCODED` / `LICENSE_ENDPOINT_XOR_KEY` as Docker
  build-args (NOT runtime env vars). Local dev builds use a parts-array
  fallback that still avoids a single string literal but is not obfuscated.

### Troubleshooting

- **`HTTP 503 LICENSE_REQUIRED`** — expected before activation. Follow the
  migration guide.
- **`The table evolution_api.RuntimeConfig does not exist`** (legacy stack
  trace if you somehow bypass the new auto-detect) — run `npm run db:deploy`.
- **`Global API key not accepted by licensing server: invalid signature`** —
  your existing `AUTHENTICATION_API_KEY` is not a valid licensing key. Use
  the manager UI flow to obtain a new one.
- **Buttons/list not rendering on WhatsApp Web** — make sure you are on
  v2.4.0+; the `<biz>` stanza node and the legacy `listMessage` payload
  shipped with this release are required for cross-client rendering.
